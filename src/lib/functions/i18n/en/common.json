		"label": "Hello",
		"text": "I'm Leon from Cologne, Germany and have been working in software development since 2017. My expertise lies in implementing projects quickly and reliably using technologies such as React, Next.js and NestJS. Working closely with my clients, I provide customised solutions that are both functional and intuitive. My focus is on a clear and understandable approach that ensures applications remain straightforward, avoiding unnecessary complexity and offering real added value to users.<br/><br/>It is important to me to communicate with my clients on equal terms to understand their visions and goals. This open dialogue enables me to develop precise and efficient solutions. For every project, whether it's a small MVP or a more extensive venture, transparency, quality, and goal-oriented implementation are crucial to me.<br/><br/>I look forward to getting to know you and your project!"
